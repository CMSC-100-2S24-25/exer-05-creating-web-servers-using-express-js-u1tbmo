## Key Takeaways

Web servers are essential parts of the Web. They are essential to how the web operates and are needed for retrieving and uploading data. Frameworks such as Express make these web servers easier to create by simplifying the process. Express is also not the only framework that can make web development easier as there are other options like Deno (with Oak), Hono, Fastify, and also frameworks on other programming languages such as Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails, etc.
